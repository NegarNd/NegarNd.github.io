I am a Ph.D. candidate, studying Electrical and Computer engineering at [New York University](https://engineering.nyu.edu), advised by Professor [Brandon Reagen](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brandon-reagen). My research interest lie in the area of privacy-preserving machine learning, hardware accelerators, and homomorphic encryption. Currently, I am a member of [NYU Center for Cybersecurity](https://cyber.nyu.edu).

I received my M.Sc degree in Computer Architecture from [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), and earned my B.Sc from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://ce.aut.ac.ir) in Tehran, Iran. In my spare time, I enjoy photography, hiking, and exploring NYC!
