__Current Projects - [Center for Cybersecurity (CCS)](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/nyu-center-cybersecurity-ccs), [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu)__
------
* Accelerating TFHE implementation
  <!-- * [Center for Cybersecurity (CCS)](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/nyu-center-cybersecurity-ccs), [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu) -->
  * Currently I an working on designing a hardware to accelerate TFHE's implementation.

* Dataflow analysis and optimization of KeySwitching algorithm for Homomorphic encryption
  <!-- * [Center for Cybersecurity (CCS)](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/nyu-center-cybersecurity-ccs), [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu) -->
  * This project was funded by DARPA, under the Data Protection in Virtual Environments (DPRIVE) program, contract HR0011-21-9-0003. 
  * Description: One of the main computational bottlnecks in HE is the key-switching workload. In this research we present a novel approach to improve key-switching performance by optimizing the dataflow and capturing on-chip reuse with far less SRAM and simultaneously reducing the off-chip bandwidth requirement.
  

* Vector Processor for Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE)-based algorithms, named RPU.
  <!-- * [Center for Cybersecurity (CCS)](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/nyu-center-cybersecurity-ccs), [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu) -->
  * This project was funded by DARPA, under the Data Protection in Virtual Environments (DPRIVE) program, contract HR0011-21-9-0003. 
  <!-- * Venue: [Dept. of Computer Science](https://compsci.colostate.edu/), [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/) -->
  * Description: We present a novel vector Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and microarchitecture for accelerating the ring-based computations of RLWE, named B512. We then propose the ring processing unit (RPU), a high-performance, modular imlpementation of B512. Having an ISA, instead of a fixed hardware design increases the flexibility to support the evolving RLWE-based workloads.
